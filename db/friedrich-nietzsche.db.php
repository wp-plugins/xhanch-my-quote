		'Love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as the are not. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'In the beautiful, man sets himself up as the standard of perfection; in select cases he worships himself in it. Man believes that the world itself is filled with beauty --he forgets that it is he who has created it. He alone has bestowed beauty upon the world --alas! only a very human, an all too human, beauty. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'We find nothing easier than being wise, patient, superior. We drip with the oil of forbearance and sympathy, we are absurdly just, we forgive everything. For that very reason we ought to discipline ourselves a little; for that very reason we ought to cultivate a little emotion, a little emotional vice, from time to time. It may be hard for us; and among ourselves we may perhaps laugh at the appearance we thus present. But what of that! We no longer have any other mode of self-overcoming available to us: this is our asceticism, our penance. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'Where does one not find that bland degeneration which beer produces in the spirit! <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'The anarchist and the Christian have a common origin. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'In every ascetic morality man worships a part of himself as God and for that he needs to diabolize the other part. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'The ascetic makes a necessity of virtue. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'The architect represents neither a Dionysian nor an Apollinian condition: here it is the mighty act of will, the will which moves mountains, the intoxication of the strong will, which demands artistic expression. The most powerful men have always inspired the architects; the architect has always been influenced by power. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'Believe me! The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously! <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'Family love is messy, clinging, and of an annoying and repetitive pattern, like bad wallpaper. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'In the mountains the shortest route is from peak to peak, but for that you must have long legs. Aphorisms should be peaks: and those to whom they are spoken should be big and tall of stature. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'Out of damp and gloomy days, out of solitude, out of loveless words directed at us, conclusions grow up in us like fungus: one morning they are there, we know not how, and they gaze upon us, morose and gray. Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but only the soil of the plants that grow in him. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'We are franker towards others than towards ourselves. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'He who cannot obey himself will be commanded. That is the nature of living creatures. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
		'Reckoned physiologically, everything ugly weakens and afflicts man. It recalls decay, danger, impotence; he actually suffers a loss of energy in its presence. The effect of the ugly can be measured with a dynamometer. Whenever man feels in any way depressed, he senses the proximity of something &quot;ugly.&quot; His feeling of power, his will to power, his courage, his pride -- they decline with the ugly, they increase with the beautiful. <br/><i>- Friedrich Nietzsche -</i>',
